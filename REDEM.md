## 🔍 Reflection

### ✅ Challenges Faced
- Designing a modular and clean structure using only vanilla JS.
- Ensuring responsiveness across all device sizes.
- Simulating backend-like interactivity (CRUD, filter, sort) without real API calls.

### 🔧 Improvements with More Time
- Add infinite scroll as an alternative to pagination.
- Include persistent storage using `localStorage`.
- Add animations/transitions for smoother UX.
- Implement dark mode toggle.
